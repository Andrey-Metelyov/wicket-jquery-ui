Kendo-UI DatePicker that use a Java Locale and the Kendo-UI Globalization<br/>
<br/>
The Kendo-UI culture file, corresponding to the Locale to be handled, should be included to the page or to the component.<br/>
For instance:<br/>
<ul>
<li><tt>Locale.FRENCH</tt> corresponds to <tt>kendo.culture.fr.min.js</tt>
<li><tt>Locale.FRANCE</tt> corresponds to <tt>kendo.culture.fr-FR.min.js</tt>
</ul>
<br/>
<pre>
public void renderHead(IHeaderResponse response)
{
	super.renderHead(response);

	response.render(
		JavaScriptHeaderItem.forReference(
			new JavaScriptResourceReference(SampleApplication.class,
				"kendo.culture.fr.min.js")));
}
</pre>

<h4>Limitation</h4>
It seems that Kendo-UI Globalize is conflicting with jQuery Globalize. Therefore it is not recommended to use both in conjunction.
