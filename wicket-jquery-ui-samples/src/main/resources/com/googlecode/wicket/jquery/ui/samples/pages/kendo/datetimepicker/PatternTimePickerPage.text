Available since wicket-jquery-ui-kendo-1.2.1<br/>

<h4>Note</h4>
The pattern used in this sample is the same between java & jQuery, so we can use <code>TimePicker#getTextFormat()</code>.<br/>
When it is not the case, you have to specify the jQuery time pattern, that matches the java time pattern, to the <code>format</code> option.
